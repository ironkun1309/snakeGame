Snake Game

## 12/10/2021 - 12/12/2021: 
  This is where I will be tracking my progress and writing my thoughts on the game.
  
  I've followed the tutorial by Zigurous and will link his video here: [How to make Snake in Unity (Complete Tutorial)](https://youtu.be/U8gUnpeaMbQ)
  
  To give a bit of background about myself. I'm a Junior who recently switched majors from Biology to Computer Science and am currently at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Furthermore, I've taken CS1301 (beginner course in Python) and CS1331 (beginner course in Java/OOP). After taking these two courses, I feel like the tutorial I've watched was a lot more straightforward compared to my earlier attempt at making a game before CS1331. An excellent example of this was how Zigurous used generics in the Snake file for the game.
  
  To further my learning, I'll be making a few changes to the game and try my best to implement my small ideas. The crucial aspect of my education is starting as small as possible and going from there. I'll provide a bullet-pointed list of where I've deviated from Zigurous game design and code.
  - Lower Saturation of the Snake to make the visual more pleasing to the player.
  - Fixed Timestep of 0.06 instead of 0.04 for an easier learning curve.
  - Snake prefab (body) of Scale 0.75 instead of 0.90. The reason for this is that I wanted to distinguish the larger Head to the body so that the entire shape resembles more of an actual snake and makes it clear where the Head of the snake is at all times, which is what the Player will control.
  - Lastly at the start of the game, the Player will start with just the head instead of having an initial size of 8.
  - For the code, I've added commentary as to why each line of code is needed.
